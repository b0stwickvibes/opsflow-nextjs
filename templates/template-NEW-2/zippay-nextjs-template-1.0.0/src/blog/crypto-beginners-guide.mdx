## 1. Start With Custody and Security

- **Hardware wallet:** cold storage for long-term holds.
- **2FA + passphrases:** never reuse secrets; store recovery safely.
- **Beware approvals:** revoke dApp permissions you no longer use.

**How to act**

- Buy a reputable hardware wallet and test a small restore.
- Create a clean “hot” wallet for daily use; keep long-term funds cold.
- Bookmark official links; avoid search-ad phishing.

> Tip: If someone rushes you, it’s a scam. Real opportunities survive scrutiny.

## 2. Build a Boring, Diversified Starter Portfolio

- **DCA approach:** fixed amount weekly, regardless of price.
- **Blue-chip bias:** stick to assets with liquidity and years of uptime.
- **Position sizing:** small bets for experiments; never all-in.
