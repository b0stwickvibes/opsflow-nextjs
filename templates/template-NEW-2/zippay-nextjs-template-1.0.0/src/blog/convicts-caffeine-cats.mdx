## 1. Build Sustainable Sprints

- **Two-week arcs:** plan in outcomes, not tasks; leave 20% for interrupts.
- **Demo always:** show the smallest valuable slice every Friday.
- **Protect focus:** 3× 90-minute blocks of deep work per day beats heroics.

**How to act**

- Cap WIP to 2 per person; if you want more, finish something first.
- Timebox reviews to 15 minutes; longer feedback goes async.
- Track energy, not just velocity — burned-out teams don’t ship better.

> Tip: Cats are great rubber ducks. Explain the bug to the cat; fix usually follows.

## 2. Communicate Like Adults

- **Write more, meet less:** default to docs with context, trade-offs, and asks.
- **Assume positive intent:** hard problems create tension; curiosity dissolves it.
- **Close loops:** every ask gets a yes/no/when — silence is a blocker.
