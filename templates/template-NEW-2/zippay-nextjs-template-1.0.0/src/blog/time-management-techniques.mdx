## 1. Plan at the Right Altitude

- **Quarterly themes → weekly commitments → daily blocks.**
- **Timebox everything:** work expands to fill the space you give it.
- **Default no:** protect two deep-work blocks a day.

**How to act**

- Keep a rolling list of “might do” — move only three items into the week.
- Schedule breaks; fatigue fakes urgency.
- Use consistent start times for routines you want to keep.

> Tip: Calendar is a to-do list with a clock. If it matters, block time.

## 2. Review, Learn, Repeat

- **Friday retros:** what moved, what stalled, what to change.
- **Energy audit:** track when you do your best work and guard it.
- **Tiny experiments:** change one thing per week; keep what sticks.
