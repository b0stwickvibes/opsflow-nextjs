## 1. Ground Strategy in Audience + Jobs-to-Be-Done

- **Segment by job:** discovery, comparison, onboarding, expansion.
- **Message ladders:** pain → promise → proof → proposal.
- **Channel-fit:** short-form video for discovery; carousels for consideration.

**How to act**

- Interview 5 customers; harvest exact phrases for hooks and CTAs.
- Build a content matrix by stage × format × claim.
- Define one conversion per post; everything else is decoration.

> Tip: Hook lines are 80% of performance. If the first two seconds don’t land, nothing else matters.

## 2. Test Creatives Like a Scientist

- **Isolate variables:** test hook first, then visual, then CTA.
- **Timeboxed sprints:** three tests/week beat one “big bang”.
- **Kill rules:** pause losers fast; redirect budget to early winners.
