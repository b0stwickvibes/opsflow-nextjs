## 1. Where AI Adds Value Today

- **Triage & routing:** symptom checkers reduce wait times.
- **Imaging support:** models flag likely findings for radiologists.
- **Operational lift:** staffing, scheduling, and claims automation.

**How to act**

- Prioritise augmenting clinicians, not replacing them.
- Pilot in low-risk workflows first; measure time saved and error rates.
- Keep humans in the loop for any patient-facing decision.

> Tip: Clinical adoption rises when AI is **inside** the existing workflow, not a new tab.

## 2. Safety, Bias, and Governance

- **Dataset provenance:** know where your training data comes from.
- **Bias evaluation:** stratify performance by age, sex, ethnicity.
- **Incident response:** treat model failures like safety events.

```yaml
governance:
  owner: 'Chief Medical Officer'
  review: quarterly
  metrics:
    - sensitivity
    - specificity
    - subgroup_parity
```
