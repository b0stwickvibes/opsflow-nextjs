## 1. Standardise Intake and Definitions of Done

Before: work arrived via chats, emails, and ad-hoc pings. After: **one intake form** creates a ticket with owner, due date, estimate, and a clear DoD.

- **Single queue:** requests funnel into one backlog with tags (team, objective, priority).
- **Duplicate control:** near-match detection bounces duplicate asks.
- **DoD templates:** per-work-type checklists (e.g., blog, feature, bug) ensure consistent quality.

**How to act**

- Map your top 5 request types and write a crisp DoD for each.
- Route _everything_ through the same form for 30 days; measure noise reduction.
- Review bounced requests weekly to refine choices and language.

> Tip: Don’t add tools first. Fix naming, states, and owners — then wire in automation.

## 2. Automate Handoffs and Surface Flow

Rules move tickets, attach templates, and ping the next owner so work never sits idle.

- **Stage transitions:** moving to “Ready” triggers the right reviewers.
- **SLAs:** if a ticket waits >24h in a column, the current owner gets nudged.
- **Portfolio view:** objectives roll up to status and risk in a single board.

```text
IF stage = "Design" AND status = "Ready"
THEN request_approval(reviewer="UX Lead") AND set_due(48h)
ELSE IF blocked_for > 24h
THEN escalate_to = "PM"
```
