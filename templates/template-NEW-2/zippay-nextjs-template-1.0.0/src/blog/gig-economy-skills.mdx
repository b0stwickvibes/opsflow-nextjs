## 1. Productise Your Services

- **Clear packages:** scope, timeline, and price in plain language.
- **Lead magnets:** publish templates or checklists that showcase your approach.
- **Testimonials:** stories beat adjectives; ask clients for outcomes.

**How to act**

- Define 3 tiers: starter, core, premium; price on value, not hours.
- Add a paid “diagnostic” to start relationships on fair footing.
- Systemise onboarding with one form and a kickoff checklist.

> Tip: If every project is custom, your margins will always be fragile.

## 2. Keep the Pipeline Predictable

- **Outbound cadence:** 10 targeted touches/week beats bursts.
- **Allies & referrals:** make it easy to recommend you.
- **Cash flow first:** milestone billing with deposits up front.

```yaml
cadence:
  mon: 5 outreach
  wed: 5 outreach
  fri: 2 follow-ups, 1 case study
billing:
  deposit: 40%
  milestone_1: 40%
  final: 20%
```
