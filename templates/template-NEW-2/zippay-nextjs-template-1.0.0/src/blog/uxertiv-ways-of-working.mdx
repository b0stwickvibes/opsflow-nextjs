## 1. Replace Status Meetings with Asynchronous Rituals

- **Weekly async check-ins:** open automatically every Monday with three prompts.
- **Roll-up views:** squad updates auto-compile into a portfolio dashboard.
- **Decision logs:** approvals happen in-app and capture context, owner, and timestamp.

**How to act**

- Pilot with one squad for 2 sprints; retire two meetings to fund the experiment.
- Use lightweight prompts: “What moved? What’s blocked? What’s next?”
- Adopt a two-minute rule: skimmable updates win participation.

> Tip: If it takes more than five minutes to write, it belongs in a doc — not a check-in.

## 2. Guardrails Over Gatekeepers

Templates set policy; automation enforces it so velocity and compliance can coexist.

- **Approval matrices:** route by amount, risk, or customer tier.
- **SLAs by type:** incidents get 1-hour reviews, experiments get 24 hours.
- **Audit trail:** every approval and exception lives next to the work.

```yaml
approval:
  spend <= 2k: SquadLead
  2k < spend <= 25k: Director
  > 25k: CFO
sla:
  incident: 1h
  feature: 24h
```
