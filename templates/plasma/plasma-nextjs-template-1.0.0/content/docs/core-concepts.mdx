## Data Flow

The data flow in Plasma follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Input Layer** - Receives data from various sources
2. **Processing Layer** - Applies business logic and transformations
3. **AI Layer** - Enhances data with intelligent insights
4. **Output Layer** - Delivers results to the appropriate destination

## State Management

Plasma uses a centralized state management system that ensures:

- **Consistency** - All components have access to the same data
- **Predictability** - State changes follow a clear pattern
- **Debuggability** - Easy to track and debug state changes

> **Important**: Always use the provided state management utilities to ensure consistency across your application.

## Event System

The event system allows different parts of your application to communicate:

```javascript
// Listen for events
plasma.on('data:processed', (data) => {
  console.log('Data processing complete:', data);
});

// Emit events
plasma.emit('user:action', { action: 'click', target: 'button' });
```

## Best Practices

- Keep your modules small and focused
- Use the event system for loose coupling
- Leverage AI capabilities for enhanced user experience
- Follow the established patterns for consistency
