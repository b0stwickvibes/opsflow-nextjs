    { value: "99.7%", label: "Uptime", change: "+0.2%" },
    { value: "3.2x", label: "ROI", change: "+45%" }
  ]}
/>
```

### BrokenGridFeature
```tsx
import { BrokenGridFeature } from '@/components/showcase';
import { Zap, Shield, TrendingUp } from 'lucide-react';

<BrokenGridFeature
  badge="ðŸŽ¯ Core Features"
  title="Everything You Need"
  subtitle="Powerful tools for modern businesses"
  features={[
    {
      title: "Real-Time Analytics",
      description: "Monitor performance live",
      icon: TrendingUp,

      accent: 'primary',
      size: 'large'
    },
    // ... more features
  ]}
/>
```

### ImmersiveScrollFeature
```tsx
import { ImmersiveScrollFeature } from '@/components/showcase';
import { Target, MapPin, Activity, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

<ImmersiveScrollFeature
  headline="Advanced Capabilities"
  subheadline="Enterprise-grade features"
  badge="ðŸš€ Pro Features"
  panels={[
    {
      title: "Predictive Analytics",
      description: "AI-powered insights...",
      icon: Target,
      benefits: [
        "Reduce costs by 35%",
        "Automated forecasting",
        "Real-time optimization"
      ],
      visual: {
        type: 'dashboard',
        color: '#8b5cf6'
      },
      stat: {

---

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- lucide-react (icons)
- Next.js (optional, works with any React setup)

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid, transforms, and IntersectionObserver
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive (except some advanced effects)

### Performance Considerations
- Uses `will-change` for transform animations
- IntersectionObserver for scroll detection (not polling)
- CSS transforms (GPU-accelerated)
- Minimal JavaScript execution on scroll

---

## Customization

### Colors
All components use CSS variables and support:
- `--primary` / `--secondary` color tokens
- OKLCH color space
- `.accent-*` wrapper classes for industry theming

### Animations
Adjust timing in component files:
```tsx
// DiagonalSplitHero
animationDuration: '8s'  // Pulse speed
transitionDelay: `${delay}ms`  // Stagger timing

// BrokenGridFeature
transitionDelay: `${index * 100}ms`  // Card reveal timing

// ImmersiveScrollFeature
duration-700  // Transition speed
```

### Layout
- DiagonalSplitHero: `min-h-[90vh]` for full viewport
- BrokenGridFeature: `py-24` for section padding
- ImmersiveScrollFeature: `min-h-[300vh]` for scroll range

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
1. **Framer Motion** integration for more complex animations
2. **Video backgrounds** in DiagonalSplitHero
3. **Interactive charts** in ImmersiveScrollFeature (Chart.js, Recharts)
4. **WebGL effects** for hero backgrounds
5. **Accessibility improvements** (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
6. **Animation performance mode** (prefers-reduced-motion)
