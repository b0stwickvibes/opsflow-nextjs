Simply describe the task (e.g., "closing procedures for kitchen"), and it generates a complete, customizable SOP in seconds‚Äîincluding safety steps, compliance requirements, and photo checkpoints. You can edit and approve before deploying.

**Q: Will predictive scheduling work during our busy season?**
A: Yes! Our ML models account for seasonality, holidays, and local events. The system learns your specific patterns (e.g., Valentine's Day rush, summer patio season) and adjusts forecasts accordingly. Accuracy improves each week as it learns your business.

**Q: What happens if a temperature sensor detects a problem during service?**
A: OpsFlow doesn't just alert‚Äîit acts. The system automatically creates a corrective action task, assigns it to the appropriate team member, sends urgent notifications, and requires photo verification that the issue is resolved. Everything is logged for health inspection audits.
