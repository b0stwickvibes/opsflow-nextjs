Personal API keys now support fine-grained permission controls. Instead of keys inheriting all your permissions, you can tailor access to specific use cases.

- Restrict keys to individual teams you have access to (public or private)
- Set keys to read-only or write-only
- Limit permissions to specific actions such as creating issues

This is a more secure approach since it minimizes each key's access surface. Configure permissions when creating new API keys or manage existing ones in Settings > Account > Personal API Keys.
